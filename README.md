# istio-demo

A service mesh or simply mesh is an infrastructure layer that enables managed, observable and secure communication between workload instances.

An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.
From the data-plane perspective Istio support two modes:

* sidecar mode (an envoy proxy running concurrently with the main application container within the same Pod)
* ambient mode (all traffic is proxied through a Layer 4-only node-level ztunnel proxies deployed as a DaemonSet)

### Requirements

Istio generally [requires](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/platform-requirements/) Kubernetes nodes running Linux kernels with `iptables` support in order to function.


### Installation

Download [Istio guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#download)

```bash
# istio 1.25.0
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -

# add istioctl bin to path
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/istio-1.25.0/bin/
```

Istio configuration profiles, are configs that provide customization of the istio (control plane and data plane), deployment topologies and target platforms.

Difference between `helm` and `istioctl` install mechanisms is that istioctl configuration profiles also include a list of Istio components that will be installed automatically by istioctl.

Further the `demo` profile is going to be used which has disabled the deployment of the default Istio gateway services

```bash
istioctl install -f bookinfo/demo-profile-no-gateways.yaml -y
# Istio core installed
# Istiod installed
# istio-system ns created: kubectl -n istio-system get all
```

### Gateways

* A **gateway** is a standalone Istio proxy deployed at the edge of the mesh. Gateways are used to route traffic into or out of the mesh
* The **Kubernetes Gateway API** is a configuration API for traffic routing in Kubernetes. It represents the next generation of Kubernetes ingress, load balancing, and service mesh APIs, and is designed with learnings from Istioâ€™s traditional APIs.

The Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs do not come installed by default on most Kubernetes clusters, so make sure they are installed before using the Gateway API.
```bash

# check if Gateway API CRD are present
kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io

# install it
kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd?ref=v1.2.1" | kubectl apply -f -
```


```bash
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/grpcroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/referencegrants.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
```

Add namespace label to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies when you deploy your application later:

```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```
